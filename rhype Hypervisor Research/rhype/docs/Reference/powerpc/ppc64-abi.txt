Chapter 1.  Introduction

ELF defines a linking interface for compiled application programs.
ELF is described in two parts.  The first part is the generic System V
ABI.  The second part is a processor specific supplement.

This document is the processor specific supplement for use with ELF on
64-bit PowerPC processor systems.

This document is not a complete System V Application Binary Interface
Supplement, because it does not define any library interfaces.

In the 64-bit PowerPC Architecture, a processor can run in either of two
modes: big-endian mode or little-endian mode.  (See Section 3.1.3.)
Accordingly, this ABI specification really defines two binary
interfaces, a big-endian ABI and a little-endian ABI.  Programs and (in
general) data produced by programs that run on an implementation of the
big-endian interface are not portable to an implementation of the
little-endian interface, and vice versa.

The 64-bit PowerPC ELF ABI is not the same as the 32-bit PowerPC ELF
ABI, nor is it a simple extension.  A system which supports the 64-bit
PowerPC ELF ABI may, but need not, support the 32-bit PowerPC ELF ABI.

The 64-bit PowerPC ELF ABI is intended to use the same structure layout
and calling convention rules as the 64-bit PowerOpen ABI.


1.1.  How to Use the 64-bit PowerPC ELF ABI Supplement

While the generic System V ABI is the prime reference document, this
document contains 64-bit PowerPC processor-specific implementation
details, some of which supersedes information in the generic ABI.

As with the System V ABI, this document refers to other publicly
available documents, especially the book titled IBM PowerPC User
Instruction Set Architecture, all of which should be considered part of
this 64-bit PowerPC Processor ABI Supplement and just as binding as the
requirements and data it explicitly includes.

The following documents may be of interest to the reader of this
specification:

  Processors.  International Business Machines (IBM).  San Francisco:

3.1.  Machine Interface

3.1.1.  Processor Architecture

The PowerPC Architecture: A Specification for A New Family of RISC
Processors defines the 64-bit PowerPC Architecture.  Programs intended
to execute directly on the processor use the 64-bit PowerPC instruction
set, and the instruction encodings and semantics of the architecture.

An application program can assume that all instructions defined by the
architecture that are neither privileged nor optional exist and work as
documented.  However, the "Fixed-Point Move Assist" instructions are not
available in little-endian implementations.  In little-endian mode,
these instructions always cause alignment exceptions in the 64-bit
PowerPC Architecture; in big-endian mode they are usually slower than a
sequence of other instructions that have the same effect.

To be ABI-conforming, the processor must implement the instructions of
the architecture, perform the specified operations, and produce the
expected results.  The ABI neither places performance constraints on
systems nor specifies what instructions must be implemented in hardware.
A software emulation of the architecture could conform to the ABI.

Some processors might support the optional instructions in the 64-bit
PowerPC Architecture, or additional non-64-bit-PowerPC instructions or
capabilities.  Programs that use those instructions or capabilities do
not conform to the 64-bit PowerPC ABI; executing them on machines
without the additional capabilities gives undefined behavior.


3.1.2.  Data Representation

3.1.3.  Byte Ordering

The architecture defines an 8-bit byte, a 16-bit halfword, a 32-bit
word, a 64-bit doubleword, and a 128-bit quadword.  Byte ordering
defines how the bytes that make up halfwords, words, doublewords, and
quadwords are ordered in memory.  Most significant byte (MSB) byte
ordering, or "big-endian" as it is sometimes called, means that the most
significant byte is located in the lowest addressed byte position in a
storage unit (byte 0).  Least significant byte (LSB) byte ordering, or
"little-endian" as it is sometimes called, means that the least
significant byte is located in the lowest addressed byte position in a
storage unit (byte 0).

The 64-bit PowerPC processor family supports either big-endian or
little-endian byte ordering.  This specification defines two ABIs, one
for each type of byte ordering.  An implementation must state which type
of byte ordering it supports.

The following figures illustrate the conventions for bit and byte
numbering within various width storage units.  These conventions apply
to both integer data and floating-point data, where the most significant
byte of a floating-point value holds the sign and at least the start of
the exponent.  The figures show little-endian byte numbers in the upper
right corners, big-endian byte numbers in the upper left corners, and
bit numbers in the lower corners.

Note: In the 64-bit PowerPC Architecture documentation, the bits in a
word are numbered from left to right (MSB to LSB), and figures usually
show only the big-endian byte order.

3.1.4.  Fundamental Types

The following table shows how ANSI C scalar types correspond to those of
the 64-bit PowerPC processor.  For all types, a NULL pointer has the
value zero.  The alignment column specifies the required alignment of a
field of the given type within a struct.  Variables may be more strictly
aligned than is shown in the table, but fields in a struct must follow
the alignment specified in order to ensure consistent struct mapping.

"Extended precision" is the IBM AIX 128-bit long double format composed
of two double-precision numbers with different magnitudes that do not
overlap.  The high-order double-precision value (the one that comes
first in storage) must have the larger magnitude.  The value of the
extended-precision number is the sum of the two double-precision values.
For a value of NaN or infinity, you must encode one of these values
within the high-order double-precision value.  The low-order value is
not significant.  Extended precision provides the same range of double
precision (about 10**(-308) to 10**308) but more precision (a variable
amount, about 31 decimal digits or more).  The software support is
restricted to round-to-nearest mode.  Programs that use extended
precision must ensure that this rounding mode is in effect when
extended-precision calculations are performed.

3.1.5.  Aggregates and Unions

Aggregates (structures and arrays) and unions assume the alignment of
their most strictly aligned component, that is, the component with the
largest alignment.  The size of any object, including aggregates and
unions, is always a multiple of the alignment of the object.  An array
uses the same alignment as its elements.  Structure and union objects
may require padding to meet size and alignment constraints:

* An entire structure or union object is aligned on the same boundary
  as its most strictly aligned member.

* Each member is assigned to the lowest available offset with the
  appropriate alignment.  This may require internal padding, depending
  on the previous member.

* If necessary, a structure's size is increased to make it a multiple
  of the structure's alignment.  This may require tail padding,
  depending on the last member.

In the following examples, members' byte offsets for little-endian
implementations appear in the upper right corners; offsets for
big-endian implementations in the upper left corners.

3.1.6.  Bit-fields

C struct and union definitions may have "bit-fields," defining integral
objects with a specified number of bits.

In the following table, a signed range goes from
    - (2 ** (w - 1)) to (2 ** (w - 1)) - 1
and an unsigned range goes from
    0 to (2 ** w) - 1
In these formulas, the operator ** represents exponentiation.

Bit-field type        Width (w)          Range
-------------------------------------------------
signed char           1 to 8             signed
char                                     unsigned
unsigned char                            unsigned
-------------------------------------------------
signed short          1 to 16            signed
short                                    signed
unsigned short                           unsigned
-------------------------------------------------
signed int            1 to 32            signed
int                                      signed
unsigned int                             unsigned
enum                                     unsigned
-------------------------------------------------
signed long           1 to 64            signed
long                                     signed
unsigned long                            unsigned


"Plain" bit-fields (that is, those neither signed nor unsigned) may have
either positive or negative values, except in the case of plain char,
which is always positive.  Bit-fields obey the same size and alignment
rules as other structure and union members, with the following
additions:

* Bit-fields are allocated from right to left (least to most
  significant) on little-endian implementations and from left to right
  (most to least significant) on big-endian implementations.

* Bit-fields are limited to at most 64 bits.  Adjacent bit-fields that
  cross a 64-bit boundary will start a new storage unit.

* The alignment of a bit-field is the same as the alignment of the base
  type of the bit-field.  Thus, an int bit-field will have word
  alignment.

* Bit-fields must share a storage unit with other structure and union
  members (either bit-field or non-bit-field) if and only if there is
  sufficient space within the storage unit.

* Unnamed bit-fields' types do not affect the alignment of a structure
  or union, although an individual bit-field's member offsets obey the
  alignment constraints.  An unnamed, zero-width bit-field shall prevent
  any further member, bit-field or other, from residing in the storage
  unit corresponding to the type of the zero-width bit-field.

Note: The 64-bit PowerOpen ABI restricts bit-fields to be of type signed
int, unsigned int, plain int, long, or unsigned long.  This document
does not have that restriction.

Note: The 32-bit PowerPC Processor Supplement specifies that a bit-field
must entirely reside in a storage unit appropriate for its declared
type.  This document only restricts bit-fields to a 64-bit storage unit.

The following examples show struct and union members' byte offsets in
the upper right corners for little-endian implementations, and in the
upper left corners for big-endian implementations.  Bit numbers appear
in the lower corners.

Note: In this example, the presence of the unnamed int and short fields
does not affect the alignment of the structure.  They align the named

members may not be aligned in memory on suitable boundaries.  For
example, the d members in an array of these structures will not all be

3.2.  Function Calling Sequence

This section discusses the standard function calling sequence, including
stack frame layout, register usage, and parameter passing.

C programs follow the conventions given here.  For specific information
on the implementation of C, see Section 3.5.

Note: The standard calling sequence requirements apply only to global
functions.  Local functions that are not reachable from other
compilation units may use different conventions as long as they provide
traceback tables as described in Section 3.3.  Nonetheless, it is
recommended that all functions use the standard calling sequences when
possible.

3.2.1.  Registers

The 64-bit PowerPC Architecture provides 32 general purpose registers,
each 64 bits wide.  In addition, the architecture provides 32
floating-point registers, each 64 bits wide, and several special
purpose registers.  All of the integer, special purpose, and
floating-point registers are global to all functions in a running
program.  The following table shows how the registers are used.

r0        Volatile register used in function prologs
r1        Stack frame pointer
r2        TOC pointer
r3        Volatile parameter and return value register
r4-r10    Volatile registers used for function parameters
r11       Volatile register used in calls by pointer and as an
          environment pointer for languages which require one
r12       Volatile register used for exception handling and glink code
r13       Reserved for use as system thread ID
r14-r31   Nonvolatile registers used for local variables

f0        Volatile scratch register
f1-f4     Volatile floating point parameter and return value registers
f5-f13    Volatile floating point parameter registers
f14-f31   Nonvolatile registers

LR        Link register (volatile)
CTR       Loop counter register (volatile)
XER       Fixed point exception register (volatile)
FPSCR     Floating point status and control register (volatile)

CR0-CR1   Volatile condition code register fields
CR2-CR4   Nonvolatile condition code register fields
CR5-CR7   Volatile condition code register fields

On processors with the VMX feature.

v0-v1     Volatile scratch registers
v2-v13    Volatile vector parameters registers
v14-v19   Volatile scratch registers
v20-v31   Non-volatile registers
vrsave    Non-volatile 32-bit register

The existence of the VMX feature will be indicated in the AT_HWCAP
auxiliary vector entry.

Registers r1, r14 through r31, and f14 through f31 are nonvolatile,
which means that they preserve their values across function calls.
Functions which use those registers must save the value before changing
it, restoring it before the function returns.  Register r2 is
technically nonvolatile, but it is handled specially during function
calls as described below: in some cases the calling function must
restore its value after a function call.

Registers r0, r3 through r12, f0 through f13, and the special purpose
registers LR, CTR, XER, and FPSCR are volatile, which means that they
are not preserved across function calls.  Furthermore, registers r0, r2,
r11, and r12 may be modified by cross-module calls, so a function can
not assume that the values of one of these registers is that placed
there by the calling function.

The condition code register fields CR0, CR1, CR5, CR6, and CR7 are
volatile.  The condition code register fields CR2, CR3, and CR4 are
nonvolatile; a function which modifies them must save and restore at
least those fields of the CR.

Languages that require "environment pointers" shall use r11 for that
purpose.


The following registers have assigned roles in the standard calling
sequence:

r1: The stack pointer (stored in r1) shall maintain quadword alignment.
It shall always point to the lowest allocated valid stack frame, and
grow toward low addresses.  The contents of the word at that address
always point to the previously allocated stack frame.  If required, it
can be decremented by the called function.  See Section 3.5.13 for
additional infromation.  As discussed later in this chapter, the lowest
valid stack address is 288 bytes less than the value in the stack
pointer.  The stack pointer must be atomically updated by a single
instruction, thus avoiding any timing window in which an interrupt can
occur with a partially updated stack.

r2: This register holds the TOC base.  See Section 3.5.2 for additional
information.

r3 through r10 and f1 through f13: These sets of volatile registers may
be modified across function invocations and shall therefore be presumed
by the calling function to be destroyed.  They are used for passing
parameters to the called function.  See Section 3.2.3 for additional
information.  In addition, registers r3 and f1 through f4 are used to
return values from the called function, as described in Section 3.2.4.

LR (Link Register): This register shall contain the address to which a
called function normally returns.  LR is volatile across function
calls.

Signals can interrupt processes (see signal (BA_OS)in the System V
Interface Definition).  Functions called during signal handling have
no unusual restrictions on their use of registers.  Moreover, if a
signal handling function returns, the process resumes its original
execution path with all registers restored to their original values.
Thus, programs and compilers may freely use all registers above except
those reserved for system use without the danger of signal handlers
inadvertently changing their values.


3.2.2.  The Stack Frame

In addition to the registers, each function may have a stack frame on
the runtime stack.  This stack grows downward from high addresses.  The
following figure shows the stack frame organization.  SP in the figure
denotes the stack pointer (general purpose register r1) of the called
function after it has executed code establishing its stack frame.

SP  --->  +-- Back chain             (SP + 0)

Low Address


The following requirements apply to the stack frame:

* The stack pointer shall maintain quadword alignment.

* The stack pointer shall point to the first word of the lowest
  allocated stack frame, the "back chain" word.  The stack shall grow
  downward, that is, toward lower addresses.  The first word of the
  stack frame shall always point to the previously allocated stack
  frame (toward higher addresses), except for the first stack frame,
  which shall have a back chain of 0 (NULL).

* The stack pointer shall be decremented by the called function in its
  prologue, if required, and restored prior to return.

* The stack pointer shall be decremented and the back chain updated
  atomically using one of the "Store Double Word with Update"
  instructions, so that the stack pointer always points to the
  beginning of a linked list of stack frames.

* The sizes of the floating-point and general register save areas may
  vary within a function and are as determined by the traceback table
  described below.

* Before a function changes the value in any nonvolatile floating-
  point register, frn, it shall save the value in frn in the double
  word in the floating-point register save area 8*(32-n) bytes before
  the back chain word of the previous frame.  The floating-point
  register save area is always doubleword aligned.  The size of the
  floating-point register save area depends upon the number of floating
  point registers which must be saved.  It ranges from 0 bytes to a
  maximum of 144 bytes (18 * 8).

* Before a function changes the value in any nonvolatile general
  register, rn, it shall save the value in rn in the word in the general
  register save area 8*(32-n) bytes before the low addressed end of the
  floating-point register save area.  The general register save area is
  always doubleword aligned.  The size of the general register save area
  depends upon the number of general registers which must be saved.  It
  ranges from 0 bytes to a maximum of 144 bytes (18 * 8).

* Functions must ensure that the appropriate bits in the vrsave register
  are set for any vector registers they use.  A function that changes
  the value of the vrsave register shall save the original value of
  vrsave into the word below the low address end of the general register
  save area.  Below the vrsave save area will be 4 or 12 bytes of
  alignment padding as needed to ensure that the vector register save
  area is quadword aligned.

* Before a function changes the value in any nonvolatile vector
  register, vrn, it shall save the value in vrn in the word in the
  vector register save area 16*(32-n) bytes before the low addressed
  end of the vrsave save area plus alignment padding.  The vector
  register save area is always quadword aligned.  The size of the
  vector register save area depends upon the number of vector registers
  which must be saved; it ranges from 0 bytes to a maximum of 192
  bytes (12 * 16).

* The local variable space contains any local variable storage
  required by the function.  If vector registers are saved the local
  variable space area will be padded so that the vector register
  save area is quadword aligned.

* The parameter save area shall be allocated by the caller.  It shall be
  doubleword aligned, and shall be at least 8 doublewords in length.  If
  a function needs to pass more than 8 doublewords of arguments, the
  parameter save area shall be large enough to contain the arguments
  that the caller stores in it.  Its contents are not preserved across
  function calls.

* The TOC save area is used by global linkage code to save the TOC
  pointer register.  See The TOC section later in the chapter.

* The link editor doubleword is reserved for use by code generated by
  the link editor.  This ABI does not specify any usage; the AIX link
  editor uses this space under certain circumstances.

* The compiler doubleword is reserved for use by the compiler.  This ABI
  does not specify any usage; the AIX compiler uses this space under
  certain circumstances.

* Before a function calls any other functions, it shall save the value
  in the LR register in the LR save area.

* Before a function changes the value in any nonvolatile field in the
  condition register, it shall save the values in all the nonvolatile
  fields of the condition register at the time of entry to the function
  in the CR save area.

* The 288 bytes below the stack pointer is available as volatile storage
  which is not preserved across function calls.  Interrupt handlers and
  any other functions that might run without an explicit call must take
  care to preserve this region.  If a function does not need more stack
  space than is available in this area, it does not need to have a stack
  frame.

The stack frame header consists of the back chain word, the CR save
area, the LR save area, the compiler and link editor doublewords, and
the TOC save area, for a total of 48 bytes.  The back chain word always
contains a pointer to the previously allocated stack frame.  Before a
function calls another function, it shall save the contents of the link
register at the time the function was entered in the LR save area of its
caller's stack frame and shall establish its own stack frame.

Except for the stack frame header and any padding necessary to make the
entire frame a multiple of 16 bytes in length, a function need not
allocate space for the areas that it does not use.  If a function does
not call any other functions and does not require any of the other parts
of the stack frame, it need not establish a stack frame.  Any padding of
the frame as a whole shall be within the local variable area; the
parameter save area shall immediately follow the stack frame header, and
the register save areas shall contain no padding except as noted for
VRSAVE.


3.2.3.  Parameter Passing

For a RISC machine such as 64-bit PowerPC, it is generally more
efficient to pass arguments to called functions in registers (both
general and floating-point registers) than to construct an argument list
in storage or to push them onto a stack.  Since all computations must be
performed in registers anyway, memory traffic can be eliminated if the
caller can compute arguments into registers and pass them in the same
registers to the called function, where the called function can then use
them for further computation in the same registers.  The number of
registers implemented in a processor architecture naturally limits the
number of arguments that can be passed in this manner.

For the 64-bit PowerPC, up to eight doublewords are passed in general
purpose registers, loaded sequentially into general purpose registers
r3 through r10.  Up to thirteen floating-point arguments can be passed
in floating-point registers f1 through f13.  If VMX is supported, up to
twelve vector parameters can be passed in v2 through v13.  If fewer
(or no) arguments are passed, the unneeded registers are not loaded and
will contain undefined values on entry to the called function.

The parameter save area, which is located at a fixed offset of 48 bytes
from the stack pointer, is reserved in each stack frame for use as an
argument list.  A minimum of 8 doublewords is always reserved.  The size
of this area must be sufficient to hold the longest argument list being
passed by the function which owns the stack frame.  Although not all
arguments for a particular call are located in storage, consider them to
be forming a list in this area, with each argument occupying one or more
doublewords.

If more arguments are passed than can be stored in registers, the
remaining arguments are stored in the parameter save area.  The values
passed on the stack are identical to those that have been placed in
registers; thus, the stack contains register images.

For variable argument lists, this ABI uses a va_list type which is a
pointer to the memory location of the next parameter.  Using a simple
va_list type means that variable arguments must always be in the same
location regardless of type, so that they can be found at runtime.  This
ABI defines the location to be general registers r3 through r10 for the
first eight doublewords and the stack parameter save area thereafter.
Alignment requirements such as those for vector types may require the
va_list pointer to first be aligned before accessing a value.

The rules for parameter passing are as follows:

* Each argument is mapped to as many doublewords of the parameter save
  area as are required to hold its value.
  - Single precision floating point values are mapped to the first word
    in a single doubleword.
  - Double precision floating point values are mapped to a single
    doubleword.
  - Extended precision floating point values are mapped to two
    consecutive doublewords.
  - Simple integer types (char, short, int, long, enum) are mapped to
    a single doubleword.  Values shorter than a doubleword are sign or
    zero extended as necessary.
  - Pointers are mapped to a single doubleword.
  - Vectors are mapped to a single quadword, quadword aligned.  This may
    result in skipped doublewords in the parameter save area.
  - Fixed size aggregates and unions passed by value are mapped to as
    many doublewords of the parameter save area as the value uses in
    memory.  Aggregrates and unions are aligned according to their
    alignment requirements.  This may result in doublewords being
    skipped for alignment.
  - An aggregate or union smaller than one doubleword in size
    is padded so that it appears in the least significant bits of the
    doubleword.  All others are padded, if necessary, at their tail.
    Variable size aggregates or unions are passed by reference.
  - Other scalar values, such as FORTRAN complex numbers, are mapped
    to the number of doublewords required by their size.

* If the callee has a known prototype, arguments are converted to the
  type of the corresponding parameter before being mapped into the
  parameter save area.  For example, if a long is used as an argument to
  a float double parameter, the value is converted to double-precision
  and mapped to a doubleword in the parameter save area.

* Floating point registers f1 through f13 are used consecutively to pass
  up to 13 single, double and extended precision floating point values,
  and to pass the corresponding complex floating point values.  A single
  precision value occupies one register as does a double precision
  value.  Extended precision values occupy two consecutively numbered
  registers.  The corresponding complex values occupy twice as many
  registers.  If the number of floating point values passed is such that
  an argument cannot be passed fully in floating point registers, that
  argument and all following floating point arguments are passed in the
  parameter save area.  Also, arguments corresponding to the variable
  argument part of a callee with a prototype containing an ellipsis are
  passed in the parameter save area.

* Vector registers v2 through v13 are used to consecutively pass up to
  12 vector values, except for arguments corresponding to the variable
  argument part of a callee with a prototype containing an ellipsis.

* If there is no known function prototype for a callee, or if the
  function prototype for a callee contains an ellipsis and the
  argument value is not part of the fixed arguments described by the
  prototype, then floating point and vector values are passed according
  to the following rules for non-floating, non-vector types.  In the
  case of no known prototype this may result in two copies of floating
  and vector argument values being passed.

* General registers are used to pass some values.  The first eight
  doublewords mapped to the parameter save area correspond to the
  registers r3 through r10.  An argument other than floating point and
  vector values fully described by a prototype, that maps to this area
  either fully or partially, is passed in the corresponding general
  registers.

* All other arguments (or parts thereof) not already covered must be
  stored in the parameter save area following the first eight
  doublewords.  The first eight doublewords mapped to the parameter save
  area are never stored in the parameter save area by the calling
  function.

* If the callee takes the address of any of its parameters, then values
  passed in registers are stored into the parameter save area by the
  callee.  If the compilation unit for the caller contains a function
  prototype, but the callee has a mismatching definition, this may
  result in the wrong values being stored.

ff            f1           8-15   (not stored)
d             r5           16-23  (not stored)
ld            f2,f3        24-39  (not stored)
s             r8,r9        40-55  (not stored)
gg            f4           56-63  (not stored)
t             (none)       64-79  (stored in parameter save area)
e             (none)       80-87  (stored)
hh            f5           88-95  (not stored)

Note: If a prototype is not in scope, then the floating point argument
ff is also passed in r4, the long double argument ld is also passed in
r6 and r7, the floating point argument gg is also passing in r10, and
the floating point argument gg is also stored into the parameter save
area.  If a prototype containing an ellipsis describes any of these
floating point arguments as being part of the variable argument part,
then the general registers and parameter save area are used as when no
prototype is in scope, and the floating point register(s) are not used.


3.2.4.  Return Values

Functions shall return float or double values in f1, with float values
rounded to single precision.

When the VMX facility is supported, functions shall return vector data
type values in v2.

Functions shall return values of type int, long, enum, short, and char,
or a pointer to any type, as unsigned or signed integers as appropriate,
zero- or sign-extended to 64 bits if necessary, in r3.  Character arrays
of length 8 bytes or less, or bit strings of length 64 bits or less,
will be returned right justified in r3.

Aggregates or unions of any length, and character strings of length
longer than 8 bytes, will be returned in a storage buffer allocated by
the caller.  The caller will pass the address of this buffer as a hidden
first argument in r3, causing the first explicit argument to be passed
in r4.  This hidden argument is treated as a normal formal parameter,
and corresponds to the first doubleword of the parameter save area.

Functions shall return floating point scalar values of size 16 or 32
bytes in f1:f2 and f1:f4, respectively.

Functions shall return floating point complex values of size 16 (four or
eight byte complex) in f1:f2 and floating point complex values of size 32
(16 byte complex) in f1:f4.


3.2.5.  Function Descriptors

A function descriptor is a three doubleword data structure that contains
the following values:

* The first doubleword contains the address of the entry point of the
  function.

* The second doubleword contains the TOC base address for the function
  (see Section 4.3 later in this chapter).

* The third doubleword contains the environment pointer for languages
  such as Pascal and PL/1.

For an externally visible function, the value of the symbol with the
same name as the function is the address of the function descriptor.
Symbol names with a dot (.) prefix are reserved for holding entry point
addresses.  The value of a symbol named ".FN" is the entry point of the
function "FN".

The value of a function pointer in a language like C is the address of
the function descriptor.  Examples of calling a function through a
pointer are provided in Section 3.5.11.

When the link editor processes relocatable object files in order to
produce an executable or shared object, it must treat direct function
calls specially, as described below.


3.3.  Traceback Tables

To support debuggers and exception handlers, the 64-bit PowerPC ELF ABI
defines traceback tables.  Compilers must support generation of at least
the mandatory part of traceback tables, and system libraries should
contain the mandatory part.  Compilers should provide an option to turn
off traceback table generation to save space when the information is not
needed.

Traceback tables are intended to be compatible with the 64-bit PowerOpen
ABI.

Compilers should generate a traceback table following the end of the
code for every function.  Debuggers and exception handlers can locate
the traceback tables by scanning forward from the instruction address at
the point of interruption.  The beginning of the traceback table is
marked by a word of zeroes, which is an illegal instruction.  If
read-only constants are compiled into the same section as the function
code, they must follow the traceback table.  A word of zeroes as
read-only data must not be the first word following the code for a
function.  A traceback table is word-aligned.


3.3.1.  Mandatory Fields

The following are the mandatory fields of a traceback table:

version        Eight-bit field.  This defines the type code for the
               table.  The only currently defined value is zero.

lang           Eight-bit field.  This defines the source language for
               the compiler that generated the code for which this
               traceback table applies.  The default values are as
               follows:
                  C             0
                  FORTRAN       1
                  Pascal        2
                  Ada           3
                  PL/1          4
                  Basic         5
                  LISP          6
                  COBOL         7
                  Modula2       8
                  C++           9
                  RPG           10
                  PL.8,PLIX     11
                  Assembly      12
               The codes 0xd to 0xfa are reserved.  The codes 0xfb to
               0xff are reserved for IBM.

globalink      One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if this routine
               is a special routine used to support the linkage
               convention: a linkage function or a ._ptrgl function.
               See the section Function Calls for more information.
               These routines have unusual register usage and stack
               format.

is_eprol       One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if this routine
               is an out-of-line prologue or epilogue function.  See
               the section Function Prologue and Epilogue for more
               information.  These routines have unusual register
               usage and stack format.

has_tboff      One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the offset of
               the traceback table from the start of the function is
               stored in the tb_offset field.

int_proc       One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if this function
               is a stackless leaf function that does not have a
               separate stack frame.

has_ctl        One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if ctl_info is
               provided.

tocless        One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if this function
               does not have a TOC.  For example, a stackless leaf
               assembly language routine with no references to
               external objects.

fp_present     One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if  the function
               uses floating-point processor instructions.

log_abort      One-bit field.  Reserved.

int_handl      One-bit field.  Reserved.

name_present   One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the name for
               the procedure is present following the traceback field,
               as determined by the name_len and name fields.

uses_alloca    One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the procedure
               performs dynamic stack allocation.  To address their
               local variables, these procedures require a different
               register to hold the stack pointer value.  This
               register may be chosen by the compiler, and must be
               indicated by setting the value of the alloc_reg field.

cl_dis_inv     Three-bit field.  Reserved.

saves_cr       One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the function
               saves the CR in the CR save area.

saves_lr       One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the function
               saves the LR in the LR save area.

stores_bc      One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the function
               saves the back chain (the SP of its caller) in the
               stack frame header.

fixup          One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the link
               editor replaced the original instruction by a branch
               instruction to a special fixup instruction sequence.

fp_saved       Six-bit field.  This field is set to the number of
               non-volatile floating point registers that the function
               saves.  The last register saved is always f31, so, for
               example, a value of 2 in this field indicates that f30
               and f31 are saved.

has_vec_info   One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the procedure
               saves non-volatile vector registers in the vector
               register save area, saves vrsave in the VRSAVE word,
               specifies the number of vector parameters, or uses VMX
               instructions.

spare4         One-bit field.  Reserved.

gpr_saved      Six-bit field.  This field is set to the number of
               non-volatile general registers that the function
               saves.  As with fp_saved, the last register saved is
               always r31.

fixedparms     Eight-bit field.  This field is set to the number of
               fixed point parameters.

floatparms     Seven-bit field.  This field is set to the number of
               floating point parameters.

parmsonstk     One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if all of the
               parameters are placed in the parameter save area.

Note: If either fixedparms or floatparms is set to a non-zero value, the
parminfo field exists.

A debugger can use the fixedparms, floatparms, and parmsonstk field to
support displaying the parameters passed to a function.  They specify
the number of parameters passed in the general registers and the number
passed in the floating point registers; they also specify whether the
parameters are stored in the parameter save area.  The parameters are
stored in the parameter save area if the number of parameters is
variable, or if the address of one of the parameters is taken, or if the
compiler always stores the parameters at the optimization level of the
compilation.  If either the fixedparms or floatparms field is set to a
non-zero value, then the next field, parminfo, can be used by a debugger
to determine the relative order and types of the parameters.


3.3.2.  Optional Fields

The following are the optional fields of a traceback table:

parminfo       Unsigned int.  This field is only present if either
               fixedparms or floatparms is set to a non-zero value.
               It can be used by a debugger to determine which
               registers were used to pass parameters to the routine
               and to determine the layout of the parameter save
               area.  This word is interpreted from left to right, as
               follows:
                  bit is 0: the corresponding parameter is a fixed
                     point parameter passed in a general register or a
                     single doubleword in the parameter save area.
                  bit is 1: the corresponding parameter is a floating
                     point parameter, and the following bit determines
                     whether the parameter is single precision (the
                     following bit is 0) or double precision  (the
                     following bit is 1).

               Note: Since this field is only 32 bits long, there is a
               limit to how many parameters can be described.  This
               limit is in the range of 16 to 32 parameters depending
               upon the type of the parameters.  Note that it takes
               two bits to describe a floating point parameter and one
               bit for each non floating point parameter.

tb_offset      Unsigned int.  This word is only present if the
               has_tboff field is set to 1.  It holds the length of
               the function code.

hand_mask      Int.  Reserved.

ctl_info       Int.  This word is only present if the has_ctl field is
               set to 1.  It gives the number of controlled automatic
               anchor blocks defined for this procedure.  If an
               exception handler is unwinding the stack to restart
               some earlier function, the the controlled automatic
               storage must be released.  Controlled automatic storage
               is used by PL/1 and PL.8.

ctl_info_disp  Int[*].  This field is only present if the has_ctl
               field is set to 1.  The ctl_info field indicates the
               number of words.  Each word is the displacement to the
               location of the information.

name_len       Short.  This field is only present if the name_present
               field is set to 1.  It is the length of the function
               name that immediately follows this field.

name           char[*].  This field is only present if the
               name_present field is set to 1.  The name_len field
               indicates the number of characters.  The name is in
               seven-bit ASCII, and is not delimited by a null
               character.

alloca_reg     Char.  This field is only present if the uses_alloca
               bit is set to 1.  It holds the register number that is
               used as the base for variable accesses.

vr_saved       Six-bit field.  This field is set to the number of
               non-volatile floating point registers that the function
               saves.  The last register saved is always vr31, so, for
               example, a value of 2 in this field indicates that vr30
               and vr31 are saved.

saves_vrsave   One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if the VRSAVE
               word in the register save area must be used to restore
               the prior value before returning from this procedure.

has_varargs    One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if this function
               has a variable argument list.

vectorparms    Seven-bit field.  This field records the number of vector
               parameters.  This field must be non-zero for a procedure
               with vector parameters that does not have a variable
               argument list.  Otherwise parmsonstk must be set.

vec_present    One-bit field.  This field is set to 1 if VMX
               instructions are performed within the procedure.


3.4.  Process Initialization

This section describes the machine state that exec creates for "infant"
processes, including argument passing, register usage, and stack frame
layout.  Programming language systems use this initial program state to
establish a standard environment for their application programs.  For
example, a C program begins executing at a function named main,
conventionally declared as follows:

extern int main (int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[]);

Briefly, argc is a non-negative argument count; argv is an array of
argument strings, with argv[argc] == 0; and envp is an array of
environment strings, also terminated by a NULL pointer.

Although this section does not describe C program initialization, it
gives the information necessary to implement the call to main or to
the entry point for a program in any other language.


3.4.1.  Registers

When a process is first entered (from an exec(BA_OS) system call), the
contents of registers other than those listed below are unspecified.
Consequently, a program that requires registers to have specific values
must set them explicitly during process initialization.  It should not
rely on the operating system to set all registers to 0.  Following are
the registers whose contents are specified:

r1: The initial stack pointer, aligned to a quadword boundary and
pointing to a word containing a NULL pointer.

r2: The initial TOC pointer register value, obtained via the function
descriptor pointed at by the e_entry field in the ELF header.  For more
information on function decscriptors, see Section 3.2.5.  For more
information on the ELF Header, see Section 4.1.

r3: Contains argc, the number of arguments.

r4: Contains argv, a pointer to the array of argument pointers in the
stack.  The array is immediately followed by a NULL pointer.  If there
are no arguments, r4 points to a NULL pointer.

r5: Contains envp, a pointer to the array of environment pointers in the
stack.  The array is immediately followed by a NULL pointer.  If no
environment exists, r5 points to a NULL pointer.

r6: Contains a pointer to the auxiliary vector.  The auxiliary vector
shall have at least one member, a terminating entry with an a_type of
AT_NULL (see below).

r7: Contains a termination function pointer.  If r7 contains a nonzero
value, the value represents a function pointer that the application
should register with atexit(BA_OS).  If r7 contains zero, no action is
required.

fpscr: Contains 0, specifying "round to nearest" mode, IEEE Mode, and
the disabling of floating-point exceptions.


3.4.2.  Process Stack

Every process has a stack, but the system defines no fixed stack
address.  Furthermore, a program's stack address can change from one
system to another, and even from one process invocation to another.
Thus the process initialization code must use the stack address in
general purpose register r1.  Data in the stack segment at addresses
below the stack pointer contain undefined values.

Whereas the argument and environment vectors transmit information from
one application program to another, the auxiliary vector conveys
information from the operating system to the program.  This vector is
an array of structures, defined as follows:

typedef struct
{
  int     a_type;
  union
    {
      long  a_val;
      void  *a_ptr;
      void  (*a_fcn)();
    } a_un;
} auxv_t;

Name                Value       a_un field

AT_NULL             0           ignored
AT_IGNORE           1           ignored
AT_EXECFD           2           a_val
AT_PHDR             3           a_ptr
AT_PHENT            4           a_val
AT_PHNUM            5           a_val
AT_PAGESZ           6           a_val
AT_BASE             7           a_ptr
AT_FLAGS            8           a_val
AT_ENTRY            9           a_ptr
AT_HWCAP            16          a_val
AT_DCACHEBSIZE      19          a_val
AT_ICACHEBSIZE      20          a_val
AT_UCACHEBSIZE      21          a_val


AT_NULL: The auxiliary vector has no fixed length; instead an entry of
this type denotes the end of the vector.  The corresponding value of
a_un is undefined.

AT_IGNORE: This type indicates the entry has no meaning.  The
corresponding value of a_un is undefined.

AT_EXECFD: As Chapter 5 in the System V ABI describes, exec may pass
control to an interpreter program.  When this happens, the system places
either an entry of type AT_EXECFD or one of type AT_PHDR in the
auxiliary vector.  The entry for type AT_EXECFD uses the a_val member to
contain a file descriptor open to read the application program's object
file.

AT_PHDR: Under some conditions, the system creates the memory image of
the application program before passing control to an interpreter
program.  When this happens, the a_ptr member of the AT_PHDR entry tells
the interpreter where to find the program header table in the memory
image.  If the AT_PHDR entry is present, entries of types AT_PHENT,
AT_PHNUM, and AT_ENTRY must also be present.  See the section Program
Header in Chapter 5 of the System V ABI and Chapter 5 of this processor
supplement for more information about the program header table.

AT_PHENT: The a_val member of this entry holds the size, in bytes, of
one entry in the program header table to which the AT_PHDR entry points.

AT_PHNUM: The a_val member of this entry holds the number of entries in
the program header table to which the AT_PHDR entry points.

AT_PAGESZ: If present, this entry's a_val member gives the system page
size in bytes.  The same information is also available through the
sysconf system call.

AT_BASE: The a_ptr member of this entry holds the base address at which
the interpreter program was loaded into memory.  See the section Program
Header in Chapter 5 of the System V ABI for more information about the
base address.

AT_FLAGS: If present, the a_val member of this entry holds 1-bit flags.
Bits with undefined semantics are set to zero.

AT_ENTRY: The a_ptr member of this entry holds the entry point of the
application program to which the interpreter program should transfer
control.

AT_DCACHEBSIZE: The a_val member of this entry gives the data cache
block size for processors on the system on which this program is
running.  If the processors have unified caches, AT_DCACHEBSIZE is the
same as AT_UCACHEBSIZE.

AT_ICACHEBSIZE: The a_val member of this entry gives the instruction
cache block size for processors on the system on which this program is
running.  If the processors have unified caches, AT_DCACHEBSIZE is the
same as AT_UCACHEBSIZE.

AT_UCACHEBSIZE: The a_val member of this entry is zero if the processors
on the system on which this program is running do not have a unified
instruction and data cache.  Otherwise, it gives the cache block size.

AT_HWCAP: The a_val member of this entry is bit map of hardware
capabilities. Some bit mask values include:

 * PPC_FEATURE_32               0x80000000 /* Always set for powerpc64 */
 * PPC_FEATURE_64               0x40000000 /* Always set for powerpc64 */
 * PPC_FEATURE_HAS_ALTIVEC      0x10000000
 * PPC_FEATURE_HAS_FPU          0x08000000
 * PPC_FEATURE_HAS_MMU          0x04000000
 * PPC_FEATURE_UNIFIED_CACHE    0x01000000


Other auxiliary vector types are reserved.  No flags are currently
defined for AT_FLAGS on the 64-bit PowerPC Architecture.

When a process receives control, its stack holds the arguments,
environment, and auxiliary vector from exec.  Argument strings,
environment strings, and the auxiliary information appear in no specific
order within the information block; the system makes no guarantees about
their relative arrangement.  The system may also leave an unspecified
amount of memory between the null auxiliary vector entry and the
beginning of the information block.  The back chain word of the first
stack frame contains a null pointer (0).


3.5.  Coding Examples

This section describes example code sequences for fundamental operations
such as calling functions, accessing static objects, and transferring
control from one part of a program to another.  Previous sections
discussed how a program may use the machine or the operating system, and
they specified what a program may and may not assume about the execution
environment.  Unlike previous material, the information in this section
illustrates how operations may be done, not how they must be done.

As before, examples use the ANSI C language.  Other programming
languages may use the same conventions displayed below, but failure to
do so does not prevent a program from conforming to the ABI.

64-bit PowerPC code is normally position independent.  That is, the code
is not tied to a specific load address, and may be executed properly at
various positions in virtual memory.  Although it is possible to write
position dependent code on the 64-bit PowerPC, these code examples only
show position independent code.

Note: The examples below show code fragments with various
simplifications.  They are intended to explain addressing modes, not to
show optimal code sequences or to reproduce compiler output.


3.5.1.  Code Model Overview

When the system creates a process image, the executable file portion
of the process has fixed addresses and the system chooses shared object
library virtual addresses to avoid conflicts with other segments in the
process.  To maximize text sharing, shared objects conventionally use
position-independent code, in which instructions contain no absolute
addresses.  Shared object text segments can be loaded at various virtual
addresses without having to change the segment images.  Thus multiple
processes can share a single shared object text segment, even if the
segment resides at a different virtual address in each process.

Position-independent code relies on two techniques:

* Control transfer instructions hold addresses relative to the effective
  address (EA) or use registers that hold the transfer address.  An
  EA-relative branch computes its destination address in terms of the
  current EA, not relative to any absolute address.

* When the program requires an absolute address, it computes the desired
  value.  Instead of embedding absolute addresses in instructions (in
  the text segment), the compiler generates code to calculate an
  absolute address (in a register or in the stack or data segment)
  during execution.

Because the 64-bit PowerPC Architecture provides EA-relative branch
instructions and also branch instructions using registers that hold the
transfer address, compilers can satisfy the first condition easily.

A "Global Offset Table," or GOT, provides information for address
calculation.  Position independent object files (executable and shared
object files) have a table in their data segment that holds addresses.
When the system creates the memory image for an object file, the table
entries are relocated to reflect the absolute virtual address as
assigned for an individual process.  Because data segments are private
for each process, the table entries can change--unlike text segments,
which multiple processes share.


3.5.2.  The TOC section

ELF processor-specific supplements normally define a GOT ("Global Offset
Table") section used to hold addresses for position independent code.
Some ELF processor-specific supplements, including the 32-bit PowerPC
Processor Supplement, define a small data section.  The same register is
sometimes used to address both the GOT and the small data section.

The 64-bit PowerOpen ABI defines a TOC ("Table of Contents") section.
The TOC combines the functions of the GOT and the small data section.

This ABI uses the term TOC.  The TOC section defined here is intended to
be similar to that defined by the 64-bit PowerOpen ABI.  The TOC section
contains a conventional ELF GOT, and may optionally contain a small data
area.  The GOT and the small data area may be intermingled in the TOC
section.

The TOC section is accessed via the dedicated TOC pointer register, r2.
Accesses are normally made using the register indirect with immediate
index mode supported by the 64-bit PowerPC processor, which limits a
single TOC section to 65,536 bytes, enough for 8,192 GOT entries.

The value of the TOC pointer register is called the TOC base.  The TOC
base is typically the first address in the TOC plus 0x8000, thus
permitting a full 64 Kbyte TOC.

A relocatable object file must have a single TOC section and a single
TOC base.  However, when the link editor combines relocatable object
files to form a single executable or shared object, it may create
multiple TOC sections.  The link editor is responsible for deciding how
to associate TOC sections with object files.  Normally the link editor
will only create multiple TOC sections if it has more than 65,536 bytes
to store in a TOC.

All link editors which support this ABI must support a single TOC
section, but support for multiple TOC sections is optional.

Each shared object will have a separate TOC or TOCs.

Note: This ABI does not actually restrict the size of a TOC section.  It
is permissible to use a larger TOC section, if code uses a different
addressing mode to access it.  The AIX link editor, in particular, does
not support multiple TOC sections, but instead inserts call out code at
link time to support larger TOC sections.


3.5.3.  TOC Assembly Language Syntax

Desire for compatibility with both ELF systems and PowerOpen systems
suggests two different assembly language syntaxes to be used when
referring to the TOC section.  This syntax is not part of the official
ABI.  The description here is only for information purposes.  Particular
assemblers may support both syntaxes, only one, or neither.

The ELF syntax uses @got and @toc.

The syntax SYMBOL@got refers to the offset in the TOC at which the value
of SYMBOL (that is, the address of the variable whose name is SYMBOL) is
stored, assuming the offset is no larger than 16 bits.  For example,
    ld   r3,x@got(r2)
SYMBOL@got will be an offset within the global offset table, which as
noted above, forms part of the TOC section.

Ordinarily the link editor will avoid having a TOC, and hence a GOT,
larger than 64 Kbytes, perhaps by support multiple TOC sections, or via
some other technique.  However, for flexibility, there is a syntax for
32 bit offsets to the GOT.  The syntaxes SYMBOL@got@ha, SYMBOL@got@h,
and SYMBOL@got@l refer to the high adjusted, high, and low parts of the
GOT offset.  (The meaning of ``high adjusted'' is explained in Section
4.5.1).

The syntax SYMBOL@toc refers to the value (SYMBOL - base (TOC)), where
base (TOC) represents the TOC base for the current object file.  This
provides the address of the variable whose name is SYMBOL, as an offset
from the TOC base.  This assumes that the variable may be found within
the TOC, and that its offset is no larger than 16 bits.

As with the GOT, the syntaxes SYMBOL@toc@ha, SYMBOL@toc@h, and
SYMBOL@toc@l refer to the high adjusted, high, and low parts of the TOC
offset.

The syntax SYMBOL@got@plt may be used to refer to the offset in the TOC
of a procedure linkage table entry stored in the global offset table.
The corresponding syntaxes SYMBOL@got@plt@ha, SYMBOL@got@plt@h, and
SYMBOL@got@plt@l are also defined.

Note that if X is a variable stored in the TOC, then X@got will be the
offset within the TOC of a doubleword whose value is X@toc.

The special symbol .TOC.@tocbase is used to represent the TOC base for
the current object file.  The following might appear in a function
descriptor definition:
      .quad .TOC.@tocbase

The PowerOpen syntax is more complex.  It is derived from the different
representation of the TOC section in XCOFF.

Assembly code first uses the .toc pseudo-op to enter the TOC section.
It then uses a label to name a particular element.  It then uses the
.tc pseudo-op to indicate which GOT entry it wishes to name.  Later in
the code, the label is used with the TOC register to load the address.
For example:
      .toc
  .L1:
      .tc  x[TC],x
      ...
      ld   r3,.L1(r2)
This creates a GOT entry for the variable x, and names that entry .L1
for the remainder of the assembly.  The effect is the same as the
single ELF-style instruction above.

The special value TOC[tc0] is used to represent the TOC base for the
current object file:
      .quad TOC[tc0]

The PowerOpen syntax permits other data to be stored in the .toc
section.  The assembler will output this data in a .toc section, and
convert references as though its address were specified with @toc rather
than @got.

There is a significant difference in representation of the TOC in this
ABI and in the 64-bit PowerOpen ABI.  Relocatable object files created
using the 64-bit PowerOpen ABI have a .toc section which contains real
data.  The link editor uses garbage collection to discard duplicate
information including in particular TOC entries which refer to the
same variable.  In this ABI, relocatable object files do not contain
.got sections holding real data.  Instead, the GOT is created by the
link editor based on relocations created by @got references.  This ABI
does not require the link editor to support garbage collection.  This
ABI does permit real data to exist in .toc sections, but this data
will never be referred to directly by instructions which use @got
references.  @got references always refer to the GOT which is created
by the link editor when creating an executable or a shared object.


3.5.4.  Function Prologue and Epilogue

This section describes functions' prologue and epilogue code.  A
function's prologue establishes a stack frame, if necessary, and may
save any nonvolatile registers it uses.  A function's epilogue generally
restores registers that were saved in the prologue code, restores the
previous stack frame, and returns to the caller.  Except for the rules
below, this ABI does not mandate predetermined code sequences for
function prologues and epilogues.  However, the following rules, which
permit reliable call chain backtracing, shall be followed:

1. If the function uses any nonvolatile general registers, it shall save
them in the general register save area.  If the function does not
require a stack frame, this may be done using negative stack offsets
from the caller's stack pointer.

2. If the function uses any nonvolatile floating point registers, it
shall save them in the floating point register save area.  If the
function does not require a stack frame, this may be done using negative
stack offsets from the caller's stack pointer.

3. Before a function calls any other function, it shall establish its
own stack frame, whose size shall be a multiple of 16 bytes, and shall
save the link register at the time of entry in the LR save area of its
caller's stack frame.

4. If the function uses any nonvolatile fields in the CR, it shall save
   the CR in the CR save area of the caller's stack frame.

5. If a function establishes a stack frame, it shall update the back
chain word of the stack frame atomically with the stack pointer (r1)
using one of the "Store Double Word with Update" instructions.

* For small (no larger than 32 Kbytes) stack frames, this may be
  accomplished with a "Store Double Word with Update" instruction with
  an appropriate negative displacement.

* For larger stack frames, the prologue shall load a volatile register
  with the two's complement of the size of the frame (computed with
  addis and addi or ori instructions) and issue a "Store Double Word
  with Update Indexed" instruction.

6. When a function deallocates its stack frame, it must do so
atomically, either by loading the stack pointer (r1) with the value in
the back chain field or by incrementing the stack pointer by the same
amount by which it has been decremented.

In-line code may be used to save or restore nonvolatile general or
floating-point registers that the function uses.  However, if there
are many registers to be saved or restored, it may be more efficient
to call one of the system subroutines described below.



3.5.5.  Register Saving and Restoring Functions

The register saving and restoring functions described in this section
use nonstandard calling conventions which ordinarily require them to be
statically linked into any executable or shared object modules in which
they are used.  Nevertheless, unlike 32-bit PowerPC ELF, these functions
are considered part of the official ABI.  In particular, the link editor
is permitted to treat calls to these functions specially, such as by
changing a call to one of these function into a call to an absolute
address as in the PowerOpen ABI.

As shown in The Stack Frame section above, the general register save
area is not at a fixed offset from either the caller's SP or the
callee's SP.  The floating point register save area starts at a fixed
position from the caller's SP on entry to the callee, but the position
of the general register save area depends upon the number of floating
point registers to be saved.  Thus it is impossible to write a general
register saving routine which uses fixed offsets from the SP.

If the routine needs to save both general and floating point registers,
code can use r12 as the pointer for saving and restoring the general
purpose registers.  (r12 is a volatile register but does not contain
input parameters).  This leads to the definition of multiple register
save and restore routines, each of which saves or restores M floating
point registers and N general registers.

3.5.6.  Saving General Registers Only

For a function that saves/restores N general registers and no floating
point registers, the saving can be done using individual store/load
instructions or by calling system provided routines as shown below.

In the following, the number of registers being saved is N, and <32-N>
is the first register number to be saved/restored.  All registers from
<32-N> up to 31, inclusive, are saved/restored.

FRAME_SIZE is the size of the stack frame, here assumed to be less
than 32 Kbytes.

    mflr  r0                    # Move LR into r0
    bl    _savegpr0_<32-N>      # Call routine to save general registers
    stdu  r1,(-FRAME_SIZE)(r1)  # Create stack frame
    ...
    (save CR if necessary)
    ...                         # Body of function
    ...
    (reload CR if necessary)
    ...
    (reload caller's SP into r1)
    b     _restgpr0_<32-N>      # Restore registers and return

3.5.7.  Saving General Registers and Floating Point Registers

For a function that saves/restores N general registers and M floating
point registers, the saving can be done using individual store/load
instructions or by calling system provided routines as shown below.

    mflr  r0                    # Move LR into r0
    subi  r12,r1,8*M            # Set r12 to general reg save area
    bl    _savegpr1_<32-N>      # Call routine to save general registers
    bl    _savefpr_<32-M>       # Call routine to save floating point regs
    stdu  r1,(-FRAME_SIZE)(r1)  # Create stack frame
    ...
    (save CR if necessary)
    ...                         # Body of function
    ...
    (reload CR if necessary)
    ...
    (reload caller's SP into r1)
    subi  r12,r1,8*M            # Set r12 to general reg save area
    bl    _restgpr1_<32-N>      # Restore general registers
    b     _restfpr_<32-M>       # Restore floating point regs and return

3.5.8.  Saving Floating Point Registers Only

For a function that saves/restores M floating point registers and no
general registers, the saving can be done using individual store/load
instructions or by calling system provided routines as shown below.

    mflr  r0                    # Move LR into r0
    bl    _savefpr_<32-M>       # Call routine to save general registers
    stdu  r1,(-FRAME_SIZE)(r1)  # Create stack frame
    ...
    (save CR if necessary)
    ...                         # Body of function
    ...
    (reload CR if necessary)
    ...
    (reload caller's SP into r1)
    b     _restgpr_<32-M>       # Restore registers and return

3.5.9.  Save and Restore Services

Systems must provide three sets of routines, which may be implemented
as multiple entry point routines or as individual routines.  They must
adhere to the following rules.

Each _savegpr0_N routine saves the general registers from rN to r31,
inclusive.  Each routine also saves the LR.  When the routine is
called, r1 must point to the start of the general register save area,
and r0 must contain the value of LR on function entry.

The _restgpr0_N routines restore the general registers from rN to r31,
and then return to the caller.  When the routine is called, r1 must
point to the start of the general register save area.

Here is a sample implementation of _savegpr0_N and _restgpr0_N.

3.5.10.  Data Objects

This section describes only objects with static storage duration.  It
excludes stack-resident objects because programs always compute their
virtual addresses relative to the stack or frame pointers.

In the 64-bit PowerPC Architecture, only load and store instructions
access memory.  Because 64-bit PowerPC instructions cannot hold 64-bit
addresses directly, a program normally computes an address into a
register and accesses memory through the register.

It is possible to build addresses using absolute code which puts symbol
addresses into instructions.  However, the difficulty of building a
64-bit address means that 64-bit PowerPC code normally loads an address
out of a memory location in the TOC section.  Combining the TOC offset
of the symbol with the TOC address in register r2 gives the absolute
address of the TOC entry holding the desired address.

The following figures show sample assembly language equivalents to C
language code.  The @got syntax is explained above, in the section TOC
Assembly Language Syntax.

Load and Store; variables are not in TOC:

C                             Assembly

extern int src;
extern int dst;
extern int *ptr;

dst = src;
                              ld  r6,src@got(r2)
                              ld  r7,dst@got(r2)
                              lwz r0,0(r6)
                              stw r0,0(r7)

ptr = &dst;
                              ld  r0,dst@got(r2)
                              ld  r7,ptr@got(r2)
                              std r0,0(r7)

*ptr = src;
                              ld  r6,src@got(r2)
                              ld  r7,ptr@got(r2)
                              lwz r0,0(r6)
                              ld  r7,0(r7)
                              stw r0,0(r7)

The next example shows the same code assuming that the variables are all
stored in the TOC.  Shared objects normally can not assume that globally
visible variables are stored in the TOC.  If they did, it would be
impossible for the variable references to be redirected to overriding
variables in the main program.  Therefore, shared objects should
normally always use the type of code shown above.

Load and Store; variables in TOC:

C                             Assembly

extern int src;
extern int dst;
extern int *ptr;

dst = src;
                              lwz r0,src@toc(r2)
                              stw r0,dst@toc(r2)

ptr = &dst;
                              la  r0,dst@toc(r2)
                              std r0,ptr@toc(r2)

*ptr = src;
                              lwz r0,src@toc(r2)
                              ld  r7,ptr@toc(r2)
                              stw r0,0(r7)


3.5.11.  Function Calls

Programs use the 64-bit PowerPC bl instruction to make direct function
calls.  The bl instruction must be followed by a nop instruction.  For
PowerOpen compatibility, the nop instruction must be:
    ori  r0,r0,0
For PowerOpen compatibility, the link editor must also accept these
instructions as valid nop instructions:
    cror 15,15,15
    cror 31,31,31

In a relocatable object file, a direct function call should be made to
the function entry point, which is a symbol beginning with dot (.).
See Section 3.2.5 for more information.

When the link editor is creating an executable or shared object, and
it sees a function call followed by a nop instruction, it determines
whether the caller and the callee share the same TOC.  If they do, it
leaves the nop instruction unchanged.  If they do not, the link editor
constructs a linkage function.  The linkage function loads the TOC
register with the callee TOC and branches to the callee entry point.
The link editor modifies the bl instruction to branch to the linkage
function, and modifies the nop instruction to be
    ld   r2,40(r1)
This will reload the TOC register from the TOC save area after the
callee returns.

A bl instruction has a self-relative branch displacement that can reach
32 Mbytes in either direction.  Hence, the use of a bl instruction to
effect a call within an executable or shared object file limits the size
of the executable or shared object file text segment.

If the callee is in a different shared object, a similar procedure of
linkage code and a modified nop instruction is used.  In this case,
the dynamic linker must complete the link by filling in the function
descriptor at run time.  See Section 5.2.4 for more details.

Here is an example of the assembly code generated for a function call:

C                             Assembly

extern void func (void);
func ();
                              bl   .func
                              ori  r0,r0,0

Here is an example of how the link editor transforms this code if the
callee has a different TOC than the caller:

C                             Assembly

extern void func (void);
func ();
                              bl   <linkage_for_func>
                              ld   r2,40(r1)

Here is an example of the linkage code created by the link editor.
Remember that func@got@plt contains the address of the procedure
linkage entry for func, which is a function descriptor.  The function
descriptor holds the addresses of the function entry point and the
function TOC base.

<linkage_for_func>:
    ld    r12,func@got@plt(r2)
    std   r2,40(r1)
    ld    r0,0(r12)
    ld    r2,8(r12)
    mtctr r0
    bctr


The value of a function pointer is the address of the function
descriptor, not the address of the function entry point itself.

C                             Assembly
extern void func (void);
extern void (*ptr) (void);
ptr = func;
                              ld    r6,func@got(r2)
                              ld    r7,ptr@got(r2)
                              std   r6,0(r7)

(*ptr) ();
                              ld    r6,ptr@got(r2)
                              ld    r6,0(r6)
                              ld    r0,0(r6)
                              std   r2,40(r1)
                              mtctr r0
                              ld    r2,8(r6)
                              bctrl
                              ld    r2,40(r1)

Since most of the code sequence used for a call through a pointer is the
same no matter what function pointer is being used, it is also possible
to do it by calling a function with an unusual calling convention
provided by a library.  With this approach, efficiency requires that the
function be linked in directly, and not come from a shared library.  The
PowerOpen ABI uses a function named ._ptrgl for this purpose, passing
the function pointer value in r11, and it is recommended that this name
and calling convention be used as well when using this approach under
ELF.


3.5.12.  Branching

Programs use branch instructions to control their execution flow.  As
defined by the architecture, branch instructions hold a self-relative
value with a 64-Mbyte range, allowing a jump to locations up to 32
Mbytes away in either direction.

C                             Assembly
label:
                              .L01:
    ...
    goto label
                                  b .L01


C switch statements provide multiway selection.  When the case labels of
a switch statement satisfy grouping constraints, the compiler implements
the selection with an address table.  The following example uses several
simplifying conventions to hide irrelevant details:

* The selection expression resides in r12, and is of type int.

* The case label constants begin at zero.

* The case labels, the default, and the address table use assembly names
  .Lcasei, .Ldef, and .Ltab, respectively.

C                             Assembly
switch (j)
  {
  case 0:
    ...
  case 1:
    ...
  case 3:
    ...
  default:
    ...
  }
                                  cmplwi  r12,4
                                  bge     .Ldef
                                  bl      .L1
                              .L1:
                                  slwi    r12,2
                                  mflr    r11
                                  addi    r12,r12,.Ltab-.L1
                                  add     r0,r12,r11
                                  mtctr   r0
                                  bctr
                              .Ltab:
                                  b       .Lcase0
                                  b       .Lcase1
                                  b       .Ldef
                                  b       .Lcase3



3.5.13.  Dynamic Stack Space Allocation

Unlike some other languages, C does not need dynamic stack allocation
within a stack frame.  Frames are allocated dynamically on the program
stack, depending on program execution, but individual stack frames can
have static sizes.  Nonetheless, the architecture supports dynamic
allocation for those languages that require it.  The mechanism for
allocating dynamic space is embedded completely within a function and
does not affect the standard calling sequence.  Thus languages that need
dynamic stack frame sizes can call C functions, and vice versa.

Here is the stack frame before dynamic stack allocation:

High address

          +-> Back chain
          |   Floating point register save area
          |   General register save area
          |   VRSAVE save word (32-bits)
          |   Alignment padding (4 or 12 bytes)
          |   Vector register save area (quadword aligned)
          |   Local variable space
          |   Parameter save area    (SP + 48)
          |   TOC save area          (SP + 40)  --+
          |   link editor doubleword (SP + 32)    |
          |   compiler doubleword    (SP + 24)    |--stack frame header
          |   LR save area           (SP + 16)    |
          |   CR save area           (SP + 8)     |
SP  --->  +-- Back chain             (SP + 0)   --+

Low address

Here is the stack frame after dynamic stack allocation:

High address

          +-> Back chain
          |   Floating point register save area
          |   General register save area
          |   VRSAVE save word (32-bits)
          |   Alignment padding (4 or 12 bytes)
          |   Vector register save area (quadword aligned)
          |   Local variable space
          |   -- Old parameter save area, now allocated space
          |   -- Old stack frame header, now allocated space
          |   -- More newly allocated space
          |   New parameter save area    (SP + 48)
          |   New TOC save area          (SP + 40)
          |   New link editor doubleword (SP + 32)
          |   New compiler doubleword    (SP + 24)
          |   New LR save area           (SP + 16)
          |   New CR save area           (SP + 8)
SP  --->  +-- New Back chain             (SP + 0)

Low address

The local variables area is used for storage of function data, such as
local variables, whose sizes are known to the compiler.  This area is
allocated at function entry and does not change in size or position
during the function's activation.

The parameter save area is reserved for arguments passed in calls to
other functions.  See Section 3.2.3 for more information.  Its size is
also known to the compiler and can be allocated along with the fixed
frame area at function entry.  However, the standard calling sequence
requires that the parameter save area begin at a fixed offset (48) from
the stack pointer, so this area must move when dynamic stack allocation
occurs.

The stack frame header must also be at a fixed offset (0) from the stack
pointer, so this area must also move when dynamic stack allocation
occurs.

Data in the parameter save area are naturally addressed at constant
offsets from the stack pointer.  However, in the presence of dynamic
stack allocation, the offsets from the stack pointer to the data in the
local variables area are not constant.  To provide addressability, a
frame pointer is established to locate the local variables area
consistently throughout the function's activation.

Dynamic stack allocation is accomplished by "opening" the stack just
above the parameter save area.  The following steps show the process
in detail:

1. Sometime after a new stack frame is acquired and before the first
   dynamic space allocation, a new register, the frame pointer, is set
   to the value of the stack pointer.  The frame pointer is used for
   references to the function's local, non-static variables.

2. The amount of dynamic space to be allocated is rounded up to a
   multiple of 16 bytes, so that quadword stack alignment is
   maintained.

3. The stack pointer is decreased by the rounded byte count, and the
   address of the previous stack frame (the back chain) is stored at
   the word addressed by the new stack pointer.  This shall be
   accomplished atomically by using stdu rS,-length(r1) if the length
   is less than 32768 bytes, or by using stdux rS,r1,rspace, where rS
   is the contents of the back chain word and rspace contains the
   (negative) rounded number of bytes to be allocated.

Note that it is only strictly necessary to copy the back chain.  The
information in the parameter save area is recreated for each function
call.  The information in the stack frame header, other than the back
chain, is only used by a called function.  In some cases, a compiler
may need to copy the TOC save area as well, depending upon precisely
how it generates linkage code.

The above process can be repeated as many times as desired within a
single function activation.  When it is time to return, the stack
pointer is set to the value of the back chain, thereby removing all
dynamically allocated stack space along with the rest of the stack
frame.  Naturally, a program must not reference the dynamically
allocated stack area after it has been freed.

Even in the presence of signals, the above dynamic allocation scheme is
"safe."  If a signal interrupts allocation, one of three things can
happen:

* The signal handler can return.  The process then resumes the dynamic
  allocation from the point of interruption.

* The signal handler can execute a non-local goto or a jump.  This
  resets the process to a new context in a previous stack frame,
  automatically discarding the dynamic allocation.

* The process can terminate.

Regardless of when the signal arrives during dynamic allocation, the
result is a consistent (though possibly dead) process.


3.6.  DWARF Definition

3.6.1.  DWARF Release Number

This section defines the Debug With Arbitrary Record Format (DWARF)
debugging format for the 64-bit PowerPC processor family.  The 64-bit
PowerPC ABI does not define a debug format.  However, all systems that
do implement DWARF shall use the following definitions.

DWARF is a specification developed for symbolic, source-level debugging.
The debugging information format does not favor the design of any
compiler or debugger.  For more information on DWARF, see the documents
cited in Chapter 1.

The DWARF definition requires some machine-specific definitions.  The
register number mapping needs to be specified for the 64-bit PowerPC
registers.  In addition, the DWARF Version 2 specification requires
processor-specific address class codes to be defined.


3.6.2.  DWARF Register Number Mapping

This table outlines the register number mapping for the 64-bit PowerPC
processor family.  Note that for all special purpose registers, the
number is simply 100 plus the SPR register number, as defined in the
64-bit PowerPC Architecture.  Registers with an asterisk before their
name are MPC601 chip-specific and are not part of the generic 64-bit
PowerPC chip architecture.

The 64-bit PowerPC processor family defines the address class codes
described in the following table:

Code                       Value         Meaning

ADDR_none                  0             No class specified



Chapter 4.  Object Files

4.1.  ELF Header

For file identification in e_ident, the 64-bit PowerPC processor family
requires the values shown below:

e_ident[EI_CLASS]   ELFCLASS64   For all 64-bit implementations.
e_ident[EI_DATA]    ELFDATA2MSB  For all big-endian implementations.
e_ident[EI_DATA]    ELFDATA2LSB  For all little-endian implementations.

The ELF header's e_flags member holds bit flags associated with the
file.  Since the 64-bit PowerPC processor family defines no flags, this
member contains zero.

Processor identification resides in the ELF header's e_machine member,
and must have the value 21, defined as the name EM_PPC64.

The e_entry field in the ELF header holds the address of a function
descriptor.  See Function Descriptors in chapter 3.  This function
descriptor supplies both the address of the function entry point and
the initial value of the TOC pointer register.


4.2.  Special Sections

Various sections hold program and control information.  The sections
listed in the following table are used by the system and have the types
and attributes shown.

Name          Type               Attributes

.glink        SHT_PROGBITS       SHF_ALLOC + SHF_EXECINSTR
.got          SHT_PROGBITS       SHF_ALLOC + SHF_WRITE
.toc          SHT_PROGBITS       SHF_ALLOC + SHF_WRITE
.tocbss       SHT_NOBITS         SHF_ALLOC + SHF_WRITE
.plt          SHT_NOBITS         SHF_ALLOC + SHF_WRITE

Note: The .plt section on the 64-bit PowerPC is of type SHT_NOBITS, not
SHT_PROGBITS as on most other processors.

Special sections are described below.

Name     Description

.glink   This section may be used to hold the global linkage table which
         aids the procedure linkage table.  See Procedure Linkage Table
         in Chapter 5 for more information.

.got     This section may be used to hold the Global Offset Table, or
         GOT.  See The Toc Section and Coding Examples in Chapter 3
         and Global Offset Table in Chapter 5 for more information.

.toc     This section may be used to hold the initialized Table of
         Contents, or TOC.  See TOC, below, The Toc Section and Coding
         examples in Chapter 3 and Global Offset Table in Chapter 5
         for more information.

.tocbss  This section may be used to hold the uninitialized portions
         of the TOC.  This data may also be stored as zero-initialized
         data in a .toc section.

.plt     This section holds the procedure linkage table.  See Procedure
         Linkage Table in Chapter 5 for more information.

Note: Tools which support this ABI are not required to use these
sections precisely as defined here, and indeed are not required to use
them at all.  The true use of a section is defined by the relocation
information and by the code which refers to it.  However, if tools use
these sections, they are required to give them the types and
attributes specified in the above table.


4.3.  TOC

The Table of Contents, or TOC, is part of the data segment of an
executable program.

This sections describes a typical layout of the TOC in an executable
file or shared object.  Particular tools need not follow this layout
as specified here.

The TOC typically contains data items within the .got, .toc and
.tocbss sections, which can be addressed with 16-bit signed offsets
from the TOC base.  The TOC base is typically the first address in the
TOC plus 0x8000, thus permitting a full 64 Kbyte TOC.  The .got
section is typically created by the link editor based on @got
relocations.  The .toc and .tocbss sections are typically included
from relocatable object files referenced during the link.

The TOC may straddle the boundary between initialized and
uninitialized data in the data segment.  The usual order of sections
in the data segment, some of which may be empty, is:

    .data
    .got
    .toc
    .tocbss
    .plt

The link editor may create multiple TOC sections, as specified in
Section 3.5.2.  In such a case, the .got and .toc sections will be
repeated as necessary, possibly renamed to preserve unique section
names.  Any occurrence of .tocbss in a TOC section other than the last
one will be converted into a .toc section initialized to contain zero
bytes.

Compilers may generate "short-form," one-instruction references for
all data items that are in the TOC section for the object file being
compiled.  Such references are relative to the TOC pointer register,
r2, which always holds the base of the TOC section for the object
file.

In a shared object, only data items with local (non-global) scope may
be addressed via the TOC pointer.  Global data items must be addressed
via the GOT, even if they appear in a .toc or .tocbss section.

A compiler which places some data items in the TOC must provide an
option to avoid doing so in a particular compilation.


4.4.  Symbol Table

4.4.1.  Symbol Values

If an executable file contains a reference to a function defined in
one of its associated shared objects, the symbol table section for the
file will contain an entry for that symbol.  The st_shndx member of
that symbol table entry contains SHN_UNDEF.  This informs the dynamic
linker that the symbol definition for that function is not contained
in the executable file itself.  If that symbol has been allocated a
procedure linkage table entry in the executable file, and the st_value
member for that symbol table entry is nonzero, the value is the
virtual address of the function descriptor provided by that procedure
linkage table entry.  Otherwise, the st_value member contains zero.
This procedure linkage table entry address is used by the dynamic
linker in resolving references to the address of the function.  See
Section 5.2.3 for details.


4.5.  Relocation

4.5.1.  Relocation Types

Relocation entries describe how to alter the instruction and data
relocation fields shown below.  Bit numbers appear in the lower box
corners; little-endian byte numbers appear in the upper right box
corners; big-endian numbers appear in the upper left box corners.

doubleword64   This specifies a 64-bit field occupying 8 bytes, the
               alignment of which is 8 bytes unless otherwise
               specified.

word32         This specifies a 32-bit field occupying 4 bytes, the
               alignment of which is 4 bytes unless otherwise
               specified.

word30         This specifies a 30-bit field contained within bits
               0-29 of a word with 4-byte alignment.  The two least
               significant bits of the word are unchanged.

low24          This specifies a 24-bit field contained within a word
               with 4-byte alignment.  The six most significant and
               the two least significant bits of the word are ignored
               and unchanged (for example, "Branch" instruction).

low14          This specifies a 14-bit field contained within a word
               with 4-byte alignment, comprising a conditional branch
               instruction.  The 14-bit relative displacement in bits
               16-29, and possibly the "branch prediction bit" (bit
               10), are altered; all other bits remain unchanged.

half16         This specifies a 16-bit field occupying 2 bytes with
               2-byte alignment (for example, the immediate field of
               an "Add Immediate" instruction).

half16ds       Similar to half16, but really just 14 bits since the
               two least significant bits must be zero, and are not
               really part of the field.  (Used by for example the ldu
               instruction.)

Calculations in the relocation table assume the actions are transforming
a relocatable file into either an executable or a shared object file.
Conceptually, the link editor merges one or more relocatable files to
form the output.  It first determines how to combine and locate the
input files, next it updates the symbol values, and then it performs
relocations.

Some relocations use high adjusted values.  These are the most
significant bits, adjusted so that adding the low 16 bits will perform
the correct calculation of the address accounting for signed arithmetic.
This is to support using the low 16 bits as a signed offset when loading
the value.  For example, a value could be loaded from an absolute 64 bit
address SYM as follows:
    lis   r3,SYM@highesta
    ori   r3,SYM@highera
    sldi  r3,r3,32
    oris  r3,r3,SYM@ha
    ld    r4,SYM@l(r3)
The adjusted forms mean that this will work correctly even if SYM@l is
negative when interpreted as a signed 16 bit number.  Compare this to
building the same 64 bit address using ori, in which case the adjusted
forms are not used:
    lis   r3,SYM@highest
    ori   r3,SYM@higher
    sldi  r3,r3,32
    oris  r3,r3,SYM@h
    ori   r3,r3,SYM@l
    ld    r4,0(r3)
These code samples are not meant to encourage people to write code
which builds absolute 64 bit addresses in this manner.  It is normally
better to use position independent code.  However, this ABI does make
this usage possible when it is required.

Relocations applied to executable or shared object files are similar and
accomplish the same result.  The following notations are used in the
relocation table:

A    Represents the addend used to compute the value of the relocatable
     field.

B    Represents the base address at which a shared object has been
     loaded into memory during execution.  Generally, a shared object
     file is built with a 0 base virtual address, but the execution
     address will be different.  See Program Header in the System V ABI
     for more information about the base address.

G    Represents the offset into the global offset table, relative to the
     TOC base, at which the address of the relocation entry's symbol
     plus addend will reside during execution.  See Section 3.5 and
     Section 5.2.2 for more information.

L    Represents the section offset or address of the procedure linkage
     table entry for the symbol plus addend.  A procedure linkage table
     entry redirects a function call to the proper destination.  The
     link editor builds the initial procedure linkage table, and the
     dynamic linker modifies the entries during execution.  See Section
     5.2.4 for more information.

M    Similar to G, except that the address which is stored may be the
     address of the procedure linkage table entry for the symbol.

P    Represents the place (section offset or address) of the storage
     unit being relocated (computed using r_offset).

R    Represents the offset of the symbol within the section in which the
     symbol is defined (its section-relative address).

S    Represents the value of the symbol whose index resides in the
     relocation entry.

The following notations are used for relocations used with thread-local
symbols.

@dtpmod
     Computes the load module index of the load module that contains
     the definition of sym.  The addend, if present, is ignored.

@dtprel
     Computes a dtv-relative displacement, the difference between the
     value of S + A and the base address of the thread-local storage
     block that contains the definition of the symbol, minus 0x8000.

@tprel
     Computes a tp-relative displacement, the difference between the
     value of S + A and the value of the thread pointer (r13).

@got@tlsgd
     Allocates two contiguous entries in the GOT to hold a tls_index
     structure, with values @dtpmod and @dtprel, and computes the
     offset to the first entry relative to the TOC base (r2).

@got@tlsld
     Allocates two contiguous entries in the GOT to hold a tls_index
     structure, with values @dtpmod and zero, and computes the offset
     to the first entry relative to the TOC base (r2).

@got@dtprel
     Allocates an entry in the GOT with value @dtprel, and computes
     the offset to the entry relative to the TOC base (r2).

@got@tprel
     Allocates an entry in the GOT with value @tprel, and computes the
     offset to the entry relative to the TOC base (r2).

Relocation entries apply to halfwords, words, or doublewords.  In all
cases, the r_offset value designates the offset or virtual address of
the first byte of the affected storage unit.  The relocation type
specifies which bits to change and how to calculate their values.  The
64-bit PowerPC family uses only the Elf32_Rela relocation entries with
explicit addends.  For the relocation entries, the r_addend member
serves as the relocation addend.  In all cases, the offset, addend,
and the computed result use the byte order specified in the ELF header.

The following general rules apply to the interpretation of the
relocation types in the relocation table:

* "+" and "-" denote 64-bit modulus addition and subtraction,
  respectively.  ">>" denotes arithmetic right-shifting (shifting with
  sign copying) of the value of the left operand by the number of bits
  given by the right operand.

* For relocation types in which the names contain "32", the upper 32
  bits of the value computed must be the same.  For relocation types
  in which the names contain "14" or "16," the upper 49 bits of the
  value computed before shifting must all be the same.  For relocation
  types whose names contain "24," the upper 39 bits of the value
  computed before shifting must all be the same.  For relocation types
  whose names contain "14" or "24," the low 2 bits of the value
  computed before shifting must all be zero.

* #lo(value) denotes the least significant 16 bits of the indicated
  value:
    #lo(x) = (x & 0xffff).

* #hi(value) denotes bits 16 through 31 of the indicated value:
    #hi(x) = ((x >> 16) & 0xffff).

* #ha(value) denotes the high adjusted value: bits 16 through 31 of
  the indicated value, compensating for #lo() being treated as a
  signed number:
    #ha(x) = (((x >> 16) + ((x & 0x8000) ? 1 : 0)) & 0xffff)

* #higher(value) denotes bits 32 through 47 of the indicated value:
    #higher(x) = ((x >> 32) & 0xffff)

* #highera(value) denotes bits 32 through 47 of the indicated value,
  compensating for #lo() being treated as a signed number:
    #highera(x) =
      (((x >> 32) + (((x & 0xffff8000) == 0xffff8000) ? 1 : 0)) & 0xffff)

* #highest(value) denotes bits 48 through 63 of the indicated value:
    #highest(x) = ((x >> 48) & 0xffff)

* #highesta(value) denotes bits 48 through 63 of the indicated value,
  compensating for #lo being treated as a signed number:
    #highesta(value) =
      (((x >> 48) + (((x & 0xffffffff8000) == 0xffffffff8000) ? 1 : 0)) & 0xffff)

* Reference in a calculation to the value G implicitly creates a GOT
  entry for the indicated symbol.

* .TOC. refers to the TOC base of the TOC section for the object being
  relocated.  See Section 4.3 for additional information.  The dynamic
  linker does not have this information, and hence relocation types that
  refer to .TOC. may only appear in relocatable object files, not in
  executables or shared objects.

Note: Relocation values 18, 23 and 32 are not used.  This is to maintain
a correspondence to the relocation values used by the 32-bit PowerPC ELF
ABI.

The relocation types whose Field column entry contains an asterisk (*)
are subject to failure if the value computed does not fit in the
allocated bits.

The relocation types in which the names include _BRTAKEN or _BRNTAKEN
specify whether the branch prediction bit (bit 10) should indicate that
the branch will be taken or not taken, respectively.  For an
unconditional branch, the branch prediction bit must be 0.

Relocations 56-66 are to be used for instructions with a DS offset
field (ld, ldu, lwa, std, stdu).  ABI conformant tools should give an
error for attempts to relocate an address to a value that is not
divisible by 4.

Relocation types with special semantics are described below.

R_PPC64_GOT16*
                These relocation types resemble the corresponding
                R_PPC64_ADDR16* types, except that they refer to the
                address of the symbol's global offset table entry and
                additionally instruct the link editor to build a
                global offset table.

R_PPC64_PLTGOT16*
                These relocation types resemble the corresponding
                R_PPC64_GOT16* types, except that the address stored
                in the global offset table entry may be the address of
                an entry in the procedure linkage table.  If the link
                editor can determine the actual value of the symbol, it
                may store that in the corresponding GOT entry.
                Otherwise, it may create an entry in the procedure
                linkage table, and store that address in the GOT entry;
                this permits lazy resolution of function symbols at run
                time.  Otherwise, the link editor may generate a
                R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT relocation as usual.

R_PPC64_COPY
                The link editor creates this relocation type for dynamic
                linking.  Its offset member refers to a location in a
                writable segment.  The symbol table index specifies a
                symbol that should exist both in the current object file
                and in a shared object.  During execution, the dynamic
                linker copies data associated with the shared object's
                symbol to the location specified by the offset.

R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT
                This relocation type resembles R_PPC64_ADDR64, except
                that it sets a global offset table entry to the address
                of the specified symbol.  This special relocation type
                allows one to determine the correspondence between
                symbols and global offset table entries.

R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT
                The link editor creates this relocation type for dynamic
                linking.  Its offset member gives the location of a
                procedure linkage table entry.  The dynamic linker
                modifies the procedure linkage table entry to transfer
                control to the designated symbol's address (see Section
                5.2.4).

R_PPC64_RELATIVE
                The link editor creates this relocation type for dynamic
                linking.  Its offset member gives a location within a
                shared object that contains a value representing a
                relative address.  The dynamic linker computes the
                corresponding virtual address by adding the virtual
                address at which the shared object was loaded to the
                relative address.  Relocation entries for this type must
                specify 0 for the symbol table index.

R_PPC64_UADDR*
                These relocation types are the same as the corresponding
                R_PPC64_ADDR* types, except that the datum to be
                relocated is allowed to be unaligned.



Chapter 5.  Program Loading and Dynamic Linking

5.1.  Program Loading

As the system creates or augments a process image, it logically copies
a file's segment to a virtual memory segment.  When--and if--the system
physically reads the file depends on the program's execution behavior,
system load, and so on.  A process does not require a physical page
unless it references the logical page during execution, and processes
commonly leave many pages unreferenced.  Therefore, delaying physical
reads frequently obviates them, improving system performance.  To obtain
this efficiency in practice, executable and shared object files must
have segment images whose offsets and virtual addresses are congruent,
modulo the page size.

Virtual addresses and file offsets for the 64-bit PowerPC processor
family segments are congruent modulo 64 Kbytes (0x10000) or larger
powers of 2.  Although 4096 bytes is currently the 64-bit PowerPC page
size, this allows files to be suitable for paging even if
implementations appear with larger page sizes.  The value of the
p_align member of each program header in a shared object file must be
0x10000.

It is normally desirable to put segments with different characteristics
in separate 256 Mbyte portions of the address space, to give the
operating system full paging flexibility in the 64-bit address space.

Here is an example of an executable file assuming an executable program
linked with a base address of 0x10000000.

0x30d00
            Other information

Here are possible corresponding program header segments:

p_type      PT_LOAD         PT_LOAD
p_offset    0x100           0x2bf00
p_vaddr     0x10000100      0x2003bf00
p_paddr     unspecified     unspecified
p_filesz    0x2be00         0x4e00
p_memsz     0x2be00         0x5e24
p_flags     PF_R+PF_X       PF_R+PF_W
p_align     0x10000         0x10000

Note: The example addresses for the text and data segments are chosen
for compatibility with AIX, and it is suggested, though not required,
that tools supporting this ABI use similar addresses.

Although the file offsets and virtual addresses are congruent modulo
64 Kbytes for both text and data, up to four file pages can hold impure
text or data (depending on page size and file system block size).

* The first text page contains the ELF header, the program header table,
  and other information.

* The last text page may hold a copy of the beginning of data.

* The first data page may have a copy of the end of text.

* The last data page may contain file information not relevant to the
  running process.

Logically, the system enforces memory permissions as if each segment
were complete and separate; segment addresses are adjusted to ensure
that each logical page in the address space has a single set of
permissions.  In the example above, the file region holding the end of
text and the beginning of data is mapped twice; at one virtual address
for text and at a different virtual address for data.

The end of the data segment requires special handling for uninitialized
data, which the system defines to begin with zero values.  Thus if the
last data page of a file includes information not in the logical memory
page, the extraneous data must be set to zero, rather than to the
unknown contents of the executable file.  "Impurities" in the other
three pages are not logically part of the process image; whether the
system expunges them is unspecified.  The memory image for the program
above is shown here, assuming 4096 (0x1000) byte pages.

One aspect of segment loading differs between executable files and
shared objects.  Executable file segments may contain absolute code.
For the process to execute correctly, the segments must reside at the
virtual addresses assigned when building the executable file, with the
system using the p_vaddr values unchanged as virtual addresses.

On the other hand, shared object segments typically contain position-
independent code.  This allows a segment's virtual address to change
from one process to another, without invalidating execution behavior.

Though the system chooses virtual addresses for individual processes,
most systems will maintain the "relative positions" of the segments.
Any use of relative addressing between segments should be indicated by
an appropriate dynamic relocation.  If the dynamic linker does not
maintain the relative position of segments at load time, it must be
careful in its handling of R_PPC64_RELATIVE relocations, examining the
relative address in order to determine the appropriate base address to
use.

The following table shows possible shared object virtual address
assignments for several processes, illustrating constant relative
positioning.  The table also illustrates the base address
computations.

5.1.1.  Program Interpreter

The standard program interpreter is /usr/lib/ld.so.1.


5.2.  Dynamic Linking

5.2.1.  Dynamic Section

Dynamic section entries give information to the dynamic linker.  Some of
this information is processor-specific, including the interpretation of
some entries in the dynamic structure.

DT_PLTGOT
              This entry's d_ptr member gives the address of the first
              byte in the procedure linkage table.

DT_JMPREL
              As explained in the System V ABI, this entry is associated
              with a table of relocation entries for the procedure
              linkage table.  For the 64-bit PowerPC, this entry is
              mandatory both for executable and shared object files.
              Moreover, the relocation table's entries must have a
              one-to-one correspondence with the procedure linkage
              table.  The table of DT_JMPREL relocation entries is
              wholly contained within the DT_RELA referenced table.  See
              Section 5.2.4 later in this chapter for more information.


5.2.2.  Global Offset Table

Position-independent code cannot, in general, contain absolute virtual
addresses.  The global offset table, which is part of the TOC section,
holds absolute addresses in private data, thus making the addresses
available without compromising the position-independence and sharability
of a program's text.  A program references its TOC using position-
independent addressing and extracts absolute values, thus redirecting
position-independent references to absolute locations.

When the dynamic linker creates memory segments for a loadable object
file, it processes the relocation entries, some of which will be of type
R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT, referring to the global offset table within the TOC.
The dynamic linker determines the associated symbol values, calculates
their absolute addresses, and sets the global offset table entries to
the proper values.  Although the absolute addresses are unknown when the
link editor builds an object file, the dynamic linker knows the
addresses of all memory segments and can thus calculate the absolute
addresses of the symbols contained therein.

A global offset table entry provides direct access to the absolute
address of a symbol without compromising position-independence and
sharability.  Because the executable file and shared objects have
separate global offset tables, a symbol may appear in several tables.
The dynamic linker processes all the global offset table relocations
before giving control to any code in the process image, thus ensuring
the absolute addresses are available during execution.

The global offset table is part of the TOC section.  Since different
functions in a single executable or shared object may have different TOC
sections, the global offset table may also be replicated, in whole or in
part.  Each instance of the global offset table will have its own set of
relocations.  The dynamic linker need not know about the replication; it
simply processes all the relocations it is given.

The dynamic linker may choose different memory segment addresses for the
same shared object in different programs; it may even choose different
library addresses for different executions of the same program.
Nonetheless, memory segments do not change addresses once the process
image is established.  As long as a process exists, its memory segments
reside at fixed virtual addresses.

The global offset table normally resides in the ELF .got section in an
executable or shared object.


5.2.3.  Function Addresses

References to the address of a function from an executable file and the
shared objects associated with it need to resolve to the same value.

In this ABI, the address of a function is actually the address of a
function descriptor.  A reference to a function, other than a function
call, will normally load the address of the function descriptor from the
global offset table.  The dynamic linker will ensure that for a given
function, the same address is used for all references to the function
from any global offset table.  Thus, function address comparisons will
work as expected.

When making a call to the function, the code may refer to the procedure
linkage table entry, in order to permit lazy symbol resolution at run
time.  In order to support correct function address comparisons, the
compiler should be careful to only generate references to the procedure
linkage table entry for function calls.  For any other use of a
function, the compiler should use the real address.

When using the ELF assembler syntax, this means that the compiler should
use the @got syntax, rather than the @got@plt syntax, if the function
address is going to be used without being called.


5.2.4.  Procedure Linkage Table

The procedure linkage table may be used to redirect function calls
between the executable and a shared object or between different shared
objects.  Because all function calls on the 64-bit PowerPC are done via
function descriptors, the procedure linkage table is simply a special
case of a function descriptor which is filled in by the dynamic linker
rather than the link editor.

The procedure linkage table is purely an optimization designed to permit
lazy symbol resolution at run time.  The link editor may generate
R_PPC64_GLOB_DAT relocations for all function descriptors defined in
other shared objects, and avoid generating a procedure linkage table at
all.

The procedure linkage table is normally found in the .plt section in an
executable or shared object.  Its contents are not initialized in the
executable or shared object file.  Instead, the link editor simply
reserves space for it, and the dynamic linker initializes it and manages
it according to its own, possibly implementation-dependent needs,
subject to the following constraint:

* If the executable or shared object requires N procedure linkage table
  entries, the link editor shall reserve 3*(N+1) doublewords (24*(N+1)
  bytes).  These doublewords will be used to hold function descriptors.
  When calling function i, the link editor arranges to use the function
  descriptor at byte 24 * i.  The first procedure linkage table entry
  is reserved for use by the dynamic linker.

As mentioned before, a relocation table is associated with the procedure
linkage table.  The DT_JMPREL entry in the dynamic section gives the
location of the first relocation entry.  The relocation table's entries
parallel the procedure linkage table entries in a one-to-one
correspondence.  That is, relocation table entry 1 applies to procedure
linkage table entry 1, and so on.  The relocation type for each entry
shall be R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT, the relocation offset shall specify the
address of the first byte of the associated procedure linkage table
entry, and the symbol table index shall reference the appropriate
symbol.

The dynamic linker will locate the symbol referenced by the
R_PPC64_JMP_SLOT relocation.  The value of the symbol will be the
address of the function descriptor.  The dynamic linker will copy these
24 bytes into the procedure linkage table entry.

The dynamic linker can resolve the procedure linkage table relocations
lazily, resolving them only when they are needed.  This can speed up
program startup time.

The following code shows how the dynamic linker might initialize the
procedure linkage table in order to provide lazy resolution:

.GLINK:
.GLINK0:
    ld      r2, 40(r1)
    addis   r12,r2,.PLT0@toc@ha
    addi    r12,r12,.PLT0@toc@l
    ld      r11,0(r12)
    ld      r2, 8(r12)
    mtctr   r11
    ld      r11,16(r12)
    bctr
.GLINK1:
    li      r0,0
    b       .GLINK0
.GLINKi:			# i <= 32768
    li      r0,i - 1
    b       .GLINK0
.GLINKN:			# N > 32768
    lis     r0,(N - 1) >> 16
    ori     r0,r0,(N - 1) & 0xffff
    b       .GLINK0

...

.PLT:
.PLT0:
    .quad   ld_so_fixup_func
    .quad   ld_so_toc
    .quad   ld_so_ident
.PLT1:
    .quad   .GLINK1
    .quad   0
    .quad   0
    ...
.PLTi:
    .quad   .GLINKi
    .quad   0
    .quad   0
    ...
.PLTN:
    .quad   .GLINKN
    .quad   0
    .quad   0


Following the steps below, the dynamic linker and the program cooperate
to resolve symbolic references through the procedure linkage table.
Again, the steps described below are for explanation only.  The precise
execution-time behavior of the dynamic linker is not specified.

1. As shown above, each procedure linkage table entry I, as initialized by
the link editor, transfers control to the corresponding glink entry I at
.GLINKI.  The instructions at .GLINKI loads a relocation index into r0 and
branches to the common .GLINK0 code, the first entry in the GLINK table.
For example, assume the program calls NAME, which uses the function
descriptor at the label .PLTi.  The function descriptor causes the program
to branch to .GLINKi which loads i - 1 into r0 and branches to .GLINK0.

2. .GLINK0 loads three values from the PLT Reserve area allocated by the
link editor and initialized by the dynamic linker.  The first doubleword
is the dynamic linker's lazy binding entry point.  The second doubleword
is the dynamic linker's own TOC anchor value.  The third doubleword is an
8-byte identifier unique to the calling module which must be placed into
r11 (normally the static chain), so that the dynamic linker can identify
the object from which the call originated, and thereby located that
object's relocation table.  .GLINK0 then calls into the dynamic linker
with the PLT index copied into r0 and the identifying information copied
into r11.

3. The dynamic linker finds relocation entry i corresponding to the
index in r0.  It will have type R_PPC_JMP_SLOT, its offset will specify
the address of .PLTi, and its symbol table index will reference NAME.

4. Knowing this, the dynamic linker finds the symbol's "real" value.  It
then copies the function descriptor into the code at .PLTi.

5. Subsequent executions of the procedure linkage table entry will
transfer control directly to the function via the function descriptor
at .PLTi, without invoking the dynamic linker.

The LD_BIND_NOW environment variable can change dynamic linking
behavior.  If its value is non-null, the dynamic linker resolves the
function call binding at load time, before transferring control to the
program.  That is, the dynamic linker processes relocation entries of
type R_PPC_JMP_SLOT during process initialization.  Otherwise, the
dynamic linker evaluates procedure linkage table entries lazily,
delaying symbol resolution and relocation until the first execution of
a table entry.

Lazy binding generally improves overall application performance
because unused symbols do not incur the dynamic linking overhead.
Nevertheless, two situations make lazy binding undesirable for some
applications:

1) The initial reference to a shared object function takes longer than
subsequent calls because the dynamic linker intercepts the call to
resolve the symbol, and some applications cannot tolerate this
unpredictability.

2) If an error occurs and the dynamic linker cannot resolve the symbol,
the dynamic linker will terminate the program.  Under lazy binding, this
might occur at arbitrary times.  Once again, some applications cannot
tolerate this unpredictability.  By turning off lazy binding, the
dynamic linker forces the failure to occur during process
initialization, before the application receives control.


Chapter 6.  Libraries

Previous versions of this document did not specify any library
interfaces.  The library ABI is defined implicitly by current
implementations including the glibc-2.3.2 powerpc64 implementation
(available from http://sources.redhat.com/glibc/).

The introduction of the VMX facility to 64-bit PowerPC requires that the
existence of this implicit ABI be acknowleged to address the change in
context size involved (i.e. __jumbuf, sigcontext, and ucontext).  This
change impacts related library functions setjmp, longjmp, getcontext,
makecontext, setcontext, and swapcontext.  Where a library implementation
existed prior to the introduction of VMX support, the runtime may need to
support multiple versions (with and without VMX state) of these functions.

The goal should be to integrate the VMX support into the libc base and
avoid a separate "VMX-libc" library as a replacement or preload.  Where
the library implementation supports versioning (eg. the glibc
shlib_compat mechanism) both versions of each function (with and without
VMX context) should be provided.  The versions without VMX context are
preserved for compatability with existing binaries.

6.1.1 __jmp_buf

The size of __jmp_bug will increase from 320 bytes (40 doublewords) to
512 bytes (64 doublewords).  The alignment will increase from doubleword
to quadword.  The offsets of the current linkage, condition, general
and floating pointer registers will not change.  The first vector
register (v20) will be saved at offset 320 (_jmp_buf index 40) continuing
through v31 at offset 496 (_jmp_buf index 63). The VRSAVE register
will be stored at offset 168.  The 32-bit VRSAVE register will share a
doubleword (_jmp_bug index 21) with the 32-bit condition register at
offset 172.

6.1.2 sigcontext and ucontext.

The size of sigcontext increases from 712 bytes to 1232. The alignment
requirement has changed from 8 to 16 bytes.  The vrsave word is stored
at offset 712 (0x2c8), v0-v31 are stored at offset 720 (0x2d0) through
1216 (0x4c0).

The size of ucontext increases from 880 bytes to 1408 bytes. The
alignment requirement has changed from 8 to 16 bytes.  The offset of
the start of the sigcontext has moved from 168 (0xa8) to 176 (0xb0) to
maintain the alignment of the sigcontext with the ucontext.  The
vrsave word is stored at offset 888 (0x378), v0-v31 are stored at
offset 896 (0x380) through 1392 (0x570).
